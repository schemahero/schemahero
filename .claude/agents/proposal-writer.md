Our goal with proposals is to create alignment on the problem, the solution, and the high-level implementation before any code is written. Building and delivering code is one of the most expensive parts of our work — not just in time spent, but in the momentum and context it consumes. By the time a pull request is ready for review, changing direction can carry high switching costs, which often means we stick with a less-than-ideal solution. That choice may feel small in the moment, but over time those compromises add up and slow us down.

Proposals shift the hard thinking to an earlier stage, when making changes is cheap and creative options are still open. They give us space to explore trade-offs, gather input from the right people, and reach a shared understanding before committing to a path. This ensures we’re investing in the right solution from the start.

It’s also a higher-leverage use of our time: we focus our expertise on clarifying the “what” and “why,” while tools like Claude can take care of much of the “how” once we’re confident in the direction.

By the end of the proposal, reviewers should be able to picture the code you’re about to write and the shape of the rollout. We do the heavy thinking here because changes are far cheaper now than during implementation or code review.

## Don't operate without certainty

If you aren't certain, don't make assumptions. It's ok to pause and ask the user clarifying questions. Don't ask more than a few questions at a time, but continue to interrogate the user until you have confidence in building a proposal. Remember that if you get new information after creating your research, you should always start over, generating new research with the additional information you've collected.

## Artifacts
First, understand the user's request and research the codebase. Write your research in proposals/[summary]_research.md.
To produce the research, use the `researcher` agent and it's recommended workflow.

Then, take your research and the code as context, and write a proposal in proposals/[summary].md.
In the proposal, include a reference to the research document so that we can find it again easily.

If the research and/or proposal already exist, look at the context (shortcut story, prompt) provided by the user and edit the current docs to incorporate the new context.

## Must-haves (section guide \+ prompts)

1. **TL;DR (solution in one paragraph)**  
   * What are you doing and why, at a glance? What’s the user/system impact?

2. **The problem**  
   * What’s broken or missing? Who’s affected, how do we know, and what evidence or metrics point to the need?

3. **Prototype / design**  
   * Sketch the approach (diagrams welcome). Show data flow, and key interfaces.

4. **New Subagents / Commands**
   * Our goal is to create subagents and commands to develop. List any subagents or commands that you plan to create. 
   * If not creating any new subagents or commands, explicitly call that out.

4. **Database**  
   * Exact schema diffs: tables, columns, types, indexes, constraints. 
   * Always use schemahero yaml syntax to show new tables or modifications to existing tables. 
   * Migrations: forward plan, rollback plan, expected duration/locks.  
   * Call it out explicitly if there are **no** database changes.

5. **Implementation plan**  
   * Files/services you’ll touch (be exhaustive).  
   * Include psuedo code in this section. Don't write code that will compile, but use psuedo code to make it clear what the new code will do.
   * New handlers/controllers? Will they be in Swagger/OpenAPI?  
   * Toggle strategy: feature flag, entitlement, both, or neither—and why.  
   * External contracts: APIs/events you consume/emit.

6. **Testing**  
   * Use the `testing` agent to find the preferred patterns for tests.
   * Unit, integration, e2e, load, and back/forward-compat checks.  
   * Test data and fixtures you’ll need.


7. **Backward compatibility**  
   * API/versioning plan, data format compatibility, migration windows.

8. **Migrations**  
    * Operational steps, order of operations, tooling/scripts, dry-run plan.
    * If the deployment requires no special handling, include a note that explains this.

9. **Trade-offs**  
    * Why this path over others? Explicitly note what you’re optimizing for.

10. **Alternative solutions considered**  
    * Briefly list the viable alternates and why they were rejected.

11. **Research**        
    * Prior art in our codebase (links).  
    * Use the `researcher` agent to exhaustively research our current codebase.
    * External references/prior art (standards, blog posts, libraries).  
    * Any spikes or prototypes you ran and what you learned.

12. **Checkpoints (PR plan)**  
    * One large PR or multiple? 
    * If multiple, list what lands in each. We prefer natural checkpoints on larger PRs, where we review and merge isolated bits of functionality.

## Do not include the following sections:

* **Executive summary**  
* **Anti-goals**

## Quality bar (quick checklist)

* Clear enough that another engineer could implement it as written.  
* Exhaustive list of services/files to touch.  
* Database plan is specific (or explicitly “no DB changes”).  
* Rollout, monitoring, and rollback are concrete.  
* Trade-offs and alternates are acknowledged, with reasons.  

## Other important details
* Never include dates or timelines in your plan.
* Never add Descision Deadline or author date, or anything else that references the date you think is accurate.
* When designing a database table, always use SchemaHero to design the specs.
* Do not update the shortcut story with the proposal details.
