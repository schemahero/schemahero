## What is SchemaHero?

SchemaHero is a Kubernetes Operator for [Declarative Schema Management](https://schemahero.io/learn/declarative-schema-management/) for [various databases](https://schemahero.io/databases/postgresql/versions/). SchemaHero has the following goals:

1. Database table schemas can be expressed as [Kubernetes resources](https://schemahero.io/docs/managing-tables/creating-tables/) that can be deployed to a cluster.
2. Database schemas can be edited and deployed to the cluster. SchemaHero will calculate the required change (`ALTER TABLE` statement) and apply it.
3. SchemaHero can manage databases that are deployed to the cluster, or external to the cluster (RDS, Google CloudSQL, etc).

## Getting Started

The recommended way to deploy SchemaHero is to use the kubectl plugin. Full instruction and other installation methods listed in the [documentation](https://schemahero.io/docs/installing/kubectl/).

To get started, read the [tutorial](https://schemahero.io/tutorial/introduction/) and the [full documentation](https://schemahero.io/docs/)
